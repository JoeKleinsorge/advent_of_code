This is primarily a learning experience, and the code may not be following best practices. I use this as a way to learn tryout a new language each year.

## Languages

| Year | Language                                                    | Stars |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 2020 | [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) | 5     |
| 2021 | [Python](https://www.python.org/)                           | 7     |
| 2022 | [Go](https://golang.org/)                                   | 4     |
